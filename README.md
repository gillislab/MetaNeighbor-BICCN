# Evaluation of BICCN cluster replicability with MetaNeighbor

In this vignette, we reproduce the MetaNeighbor cluster replicability analyses presented in the [BICCN molecular mini-atlas manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.970558v2), and provide guidance for users wishing to rapidly compare their own data to the BICCN MOp reference.
